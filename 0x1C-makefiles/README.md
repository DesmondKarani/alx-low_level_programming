## Description
This project is focused on learning and implementing Makefiles in C programming. It serves to understand the usage, benefits, and structure of Makefiles in automating the build process.

## Objectives
- Understand what Make and Makefiles are and their role in software development.
- Learn when, why, and how to use Makefiles.
- Get acquainted with rules in Makefiles, including setting and using them.
- Differentiate between explicit and implicit rules.
- Explore common and useful rules in Makefiles.
- Understand the use of variables in Makefiles.

- **Compiler**: gcc 9.3.0
- **Make Version**: GNU Make 4.2.1
- All files should end with a new line

## Installation & Usage
This section should provide instructions on how to install and run your project. Include steps to clone the repository, navigate to the appropriate directory, and any commands needed to compile the code using your Makefile.

Example:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
make
```

## Files
List the specific files included in the project and a brief description of each. For instance:

- `main.c` - Main file of the project.
- `functions.c` - Additional functions used in the project.
- `header.h` - Header file containing function prototypes and macros.
- `Makefile` - Contains the rules for building the project.
